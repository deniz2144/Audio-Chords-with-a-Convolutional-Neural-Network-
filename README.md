Audio Chords with a Convolutional Neural Network 

Major and Minor Chord Classification with CNN
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to call audio signals as major and minor chords. A model has been developed to study chords by analyzing spectrograms of sound cells. The model visually divides audio signals into spectrograms and classifies chords using these divisions. This project provides a basis for automatic classification of musical chords and is available in various applications related to music analysis.
